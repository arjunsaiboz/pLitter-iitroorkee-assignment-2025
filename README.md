# pLitter Riverine Plastic Detection  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project adapts the **pLitter** model to enhance plastic litter detection in **riverine environments**. The goal is to modify the existing YOLO-based detection system for improved performance in water bodies.  

## 🚀 Features Implemented  
- **Model Adaptation for Riverine Settings**: Fine-tuned the YOLO model on water-based litter datasets.  
- **Enhanced Object Detection**: Optimized hyperparameters for better detection in floating environments.  
- **Real-Time Litter Counting**: Embedded numeric overlays in video to track detected plastic objects.  
- **Performance Optimization**: Adjusted confidence threshold and IoU for higher accuracy.
