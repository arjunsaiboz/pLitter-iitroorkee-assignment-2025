# pLitter-iitroorkee-assignment-2025
This repository contains an adapted version of the pLitter deep learning model for detecting plastic litter in riverine environments. The project fine-tunes the YOLO-based detection system to improve accuracy in water bodies. It includes dataset preparation, model training, real-time litter counting, and video embedding of detected objects.
